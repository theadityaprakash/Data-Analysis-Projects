## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to extract meaningful insights that can help improve business decisions. The analysis was conducted using **MySQL** for data extraction and manipulation, and **Power BI** for visualization and presentation of the results. The goal was to identify trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be leveraged to optimize sales, inventory management, and customer satisfaction.

## Project Objectives

- **Analyze Sales Performance:** Understand the sales performance across different types of pizzas, sizes, and times.
- **Identify Customer Preferences:** Determine which pizzas are most popular among customers.
- **Optimize Inventory:** Assess inventory levels and identify areas for improvement.
- **Visualize Data:** Present findings through interactive and easy-to-understand visualizations using Power BI.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project is a collection of pizza sales data. The key attributes in the dataset include:

- **Order ID:** Unique identifier for each order.
- **Pizza Type:** The type of pizza sold (e.g., Margherita, Pepperoni, etc.).
- **Pizza Size:** The size of the pizza (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
- **Quantity:** The number of pizzas sold.
- **Order Date:** The date and time the order was placed.
- **Revenue:** The total revenue generated from the sale.
- **Cost:** The cost associated with making the pizza.
- **Profit:** The profit margin for each order.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Ensured data consistency by handling missing values and correcting any discrepancies in the dataset.
   - Normalized the data to ensure uniformity in pizza types and sizes.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using MySQL to understand the distribution of orders, sales trends, and customer preferences.
   - Calculated key metrics such as total sales, average revenue per order, and most popular pizza types.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize the data.
   - Visualized sales performance by pizza type, size, and time period.
   - Developed charts to show the relationship between sales and profit margins.
   - Displayed inventory levels and provided recommendations for optimizing stock.

4. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Identified the best-selling pizzas and peak sales times.
   - Highlighted areas where inventory could be optimized to reduce waste and increase profitability.
   - Suggested promotional strategies based on customer preferences and sales trends.

## Results

The analysis provided several key insights that can help the business optimize its operations:

- **Top-Selling Pizzas:** The analysis revealed that certain pizza types and sizes consistently perform better, especially during weekends and dinner times.
- **Sales Trends:** A clear pattern emerged showing that sales peak during certain hours of the day and days of the week, providing an opportunity for targeted promotions.
- **Profit Margins:** Some pizzas have higher profit margins, suggesting a focus on promoting these items could enhance overall profitability.
- **Inventory Management:** Recommendations were made to adjust inventory levels based on sales patterns, reducing waste and ensuring popular items are always available.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the power of data analysis in driving business decisions. By leveraging SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization, we were able to provide actionable insights that can help optimize sales strategies, inventory management, and customer satisfaction.

## Tools and Technologies
